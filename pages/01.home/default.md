# Welcome to mootParadox

### Info

What happened to the old site? For the last couple of weeks the answer has been, "*The old version of this site is temporarily offline while I have a bit of an experiment with Grav CMS*". The updated answer is that [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) looks great and I'm sticking with it! :-)

!!! You can learn about **Grav** at their [Learn Grav](http://learn.getgrav.org) site.

### What Next?

I'm bringing the hiking blog posts across from my old site, with [improved maps](/projects/simple-self-hosted-gpx-map) and better versions of the photographs. Follow these links to blog posts related to [Outdoors](/outdoors), and some [planned](/outdoors/tag:planned) Wainwright-bagging routes.

There may also be a few [Projects](/projects), probably with a techie twist.

*Red Tarn with Swirral Edge to the left.*

The previous versions of these hiking trip-reports featured low-quality JPG maps (or none at all) and the photographs were scaled down to 400px wide. The example above comes from [Catstycam to Sheffield Pike](/outdoors/catstycam-to-sheffield-pike).

### Walking the Wainwrights

This has been a long-running project, and by long-running I'm talking 10+ years! The tables below list his seven classic volumes and the routes I've walked so far. These have been some great days out, and the Wainwright Bagging count stands at **98** - and getting dangerously close to halfway.

The Wikipedia article [List of Wainwrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wainwrights) is a useful resource.
