# Welcome to mootParadox

### Info

What happened to the old site? For the last couple of weeks the answer has been, "_The old version of this site is temporarily offline while I have a bit of an experiment with Grav CMS_". The updated answer is that [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) looks great and I'm sticking with it! :-)

!!! You can learn about **Grav** at their [Learn Grav](http://learn.getgrav.org) site.

### What Next?

I'm bringing the hiking blog posts across from my old site, with [improved maps](/blog/simple-self-hosted-gpx-map) and better quality versions of the photographs. Find blog posts related to [Hiking](/hiking), or [Coding](/coding).

![](/hiking/catstycam-to-sheffield-pike/swirral-edge-and-red-tarn.jpg)
*Red Tarn with Swirral Edge to the left.*

The previous versions of these hiking trip-reports featured JPG maps (or none at all) and the photographs were scaled down to 400px wide. The example above comes from [Catstycam to Sheffield Pike](/hiking/catstycam-to-sheffield-pike).
