Monday 9th August, 2010, marked my return to the Lake District fells after an absence of about 19 years. Half a lifetime ago, my Duke of Edinburgh expedition for the Gold award, marked my last hill walking of any significance. Under the relentless barage of Steven Horner's tales from the mountains, and the revelations that you don't need to carry a 20kg pack any more, I finally succumbed to the lure of the hills.

To give it some purpose, I intend to embark on some Wainwright bagging, with a view to clocking up all 214. I'm ignoring the few dozen I'll have done in the past, starting with a clean slate. As of Monday, the total stands at 4. These being Souther Fell, Blencathra, Bannerdale Crags and Bowscale Fell.
