This route from 9th July 2015 makes for a longish day-walk from Catstycam to Sheffield Pike. The distance is 20km (with 1.6km of ascent) and it will take you to the summit of 9 Wainwrights.

!!!! A 20km circular route, starting from Glenridding. (_Wainwright Book 1: The Eastern Fells_)

I camped overnight at Gillside, just outside of Glenridding. Many years before, if memory serves, I'd camped there with the Cadets. On that occasion we had climbed Helvellyn, via Swirral Edge, and on our second day we climbed High Street. Today though, I was heading back to Helvellyn, also via Swirral Edge, but I decided to climb Catstycam's north ridge, that's from the Brown Cove side. My camera lens went faulty somewhere along the route, with some very odd blurring and lens-flaring, so the photos may be a little sporadic. Luckily I also took a few on my mobile.
