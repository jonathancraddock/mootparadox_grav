This route from 9th July 2015 made for a longish day-walk, from Catstycam to Sheffield Pike. The distance is 20km (with 1.6km of ascent) and it takes in the summit of 9 Wainwrights.

!!!! A 20km circular route, starting from Glenridding. (_Wainwright Book 1: The Eastern Fells_)

I camped overnight at Gillside, just outside of Glenridding.

Many years before, if memory serves, I also camped here with the Cadets. On that occasion we climbed Helvellyn, via Swirral Edge, and on our second day we climbed High Street. Today though, I was heading back to Helvellyn, again via Swirral Edge, but I wanted to climb Catstycam's northern ridge; that's from the Brown Cove side.

My camera lens went faulty somewhere along the route (some very odd blurring and lens-flaring) so the photos may be somewhat sporadic. Luckily I also took a few on my mobile.
