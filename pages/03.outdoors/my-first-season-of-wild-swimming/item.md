Open water swimming has been making a splash in the last few years. Lockdown related pool closures may have been a spring-board, but there's also increasing awareness of the health benefits. You will find two camps. The "you must be joking" camp, and the "evangelists". Having made this transition personally I can empathise with both parties, even though the first lot have got it wrong!

===

In May of 2020, with swimming pools closed and missing my weekly fix, I bought an [Alpkit Lotic](https://alpkit.com/products/lotic-mens) wetsuit and embarked on my first outdoor swim. The UK spring of 2020 was the fifth warmest on record, with more sunshine hours than a typical summer. It was soon to be followed by a summer heatwave, so the North Tyne was almost tropical, or at least, well into the upper teens.

You can expect to pay at least £100 for a decent wetsuit, and the Lotic floats around £150, although I was lucky and found it on sale for £125. Other *name* brands (you might think Roka, C-Skins, Zone3, Orca) are probably going to cost somewhat more. But, as a confident swimmer, happy to embark on a steady couple of miles freestyle, I had no complaints with my Lotic. My only tip would be, check it's a *swimming* wetsuit, as wetsuits for sailing, kayaking, surfing, and other sports, will have a different balance or a different range of mobility through the shoulders, and so on.

*First dip*

If you have never swum in a wetsuit before, you're going to be surprised by how buoyant they are. You have the twin benefits of staying comfortable in the water for longer, plus you can lay in the water and float with almost no effort. Just to pre-empt any surprises, remember that wetsuits work by trapping a layer of water against your skin. Don't be surprised by the rush of cold water when you enter the water, typically through the zip in the small of your back ("Oooooh!") and again when you start swimming ("Eeeeep!") and more water enters around the neck. Just get moving - you'll be fine!

On my first swim I borrowed a swim hat (yellow) and quickly bought my own (blue). It's worth it. Not only does it help keep your head slightly warmer but also it's great for your visibility in the water. Get one that covers your ears. The water still gets in, but it cuts out the discomfort of cold wind into damp ears.

And that seems like a neat segue into tow floats which serve multiple purposes too; visibility being just one. I chose the "Guardian" by [Ulu Drybags](https://uludrybags.com/), but there are plenty to choose from. This model has several nice features, including high-visibility reflecting panels, an emergency whistle, convenient grab-handles, and it's a decent size. It works as a drybag, but it's almost impossible to avoid some dampness, particularly if you need to get something out of it while you're still in the water; your GoPro camera, for example. Being a cautious chap, I double-up by putting my mobile phone, car keys and wallet, inside a second drybag, and so far so good.

Once you've decided to take the plunge, you'll need to find some water and it will surprise nobody that England and Wales trail behind Scotland and Europe in terms of public access rights to water. The sea and navigable waterways are probably ok, but not if it's a canal. Lakes and tarns might be ok, but not if it's a reservoir - unless you're in Scotland. Confused? Finding some swimming friends and sharing information is ideal, but there are some additional resources below.
