Open water swimming has been making a splash recently, in part because of lockdown related pool closures, but also there's an increased awareness of the health benefits. There's two camps and I'll call them "you must be joking" camp, and the "evangelists". Having made this transition personally, I can empathise with both parties; even though the first lot are wrong!

===

In May of 2020, with swimming pools closed and missing my weekly fix, I bought an [Alpkit Lotic](https://alpkit.com/products/lotic-mens) wetsuit and embarked on my first outdoor swim. The UK spring of 2020 was the fifth warmest on record, with more sunshine hours than a typical summer. It was soon to be followed by a summer heatwave, so the North Tyne was almost tropical, or at least, well into the upper teens.

You can expect to pay over £100 for a decent wetsuit, the Lotic floating around £150, but I was lucky and found it on sale for £125. Other *name* brands (and you might think of C-Skins, Zone3, Orca, and so on) are probably going to cost you a little more. But, as a confident swimmer, happily covering a couple of miles of freestyle in the pool, I had no complaints with my Lotic.

*First dip*

If you have never swum in a wetsuit before, you're going to be surprised by how buoyant they are. You have the twin benefits of being comfortable in the water for longer, plus you can lay in the water and float with almost no effort. Just to pre-empt any surprises, remember that wetsuits work by trapping a layer of water against your skin. You will get a rush of cold water when the water first enters, typically through the zip in the small of your back, and again when you start swimming and more water enters around the neck. Just get moving, and it'll be fine!

On my first swim I borrowed a swim hat (yellow) and quickly bought my own (blue). It's worth it. It does help to keep your head slightly warmer, but also it's great for your visibility in the water.

Which seems like a neat segue into tow floats and these serve multiple purposes too, visibility being just one. I chose the Guardian by [Ulu Drybags](https://uludrybags.com/), but there are plenty to choose from. This model has several nice features, including high-visibility reflecting panels, an emergency whistle, convenient grab-handles, and it's a decent size. It works as a fairly effective drybag, but it's almost impossible to avoid some dampness, particularly if you need to get something out of it in the water; your GoPro camera, for example. Being a cautious chap, I double-up by putting my mobile, car keys and wallet inside a second drybag; so far, so good.
