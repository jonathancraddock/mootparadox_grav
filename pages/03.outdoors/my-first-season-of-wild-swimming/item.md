Open water swimming has been making a splash recently, in part because of lockdown indoor pool closures, and also with increased awareness of the health benefits. There are roughly two camps which are best summarised as "you must be joking" and "evangelists". Having made this transition myself, I can empathise with both positions; even though the first group are wrong!

In May of 2020, with swimming pools closed and missing my weekly fix, I bought an [Alpkit Lotic](https://alpkit.com/products/lotic-mens) wetsuit and embarked on my first outdoor swim.
