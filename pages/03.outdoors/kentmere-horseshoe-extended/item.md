Planned...

!!!! A 19km horseshoe, starting from Kentmere village. (*Wainwright Book 2: The Far Eastern Fells*)

#### Traditional Kentmere Horseshoe

I believe this GPX follows the traditional route.

#### Extended Horseshoe

The traditional Kentmere Horseshoe does not include Sallows and Sour Howes, but with sufficient energy they could be added beyond the summit of Yoke, before returning to Kentmere. It would add a minimum of 3km to the route.
