Most of my outdoor swimming has required entering end exiting the water at the same place. It's the common approach and after a while you'll find the gear that works best for you.. I've seen rucksacks, Ikea bags, doormats, bathmats, and various other combinations. But, what happens if you don't want to return to your starting point?

===

My usual kit consists of an [Alpkit Gourdon 30L waterproof pack](https://alpkit.com/products/gourdon-30-waterproof-rucksack#) fitted with a cut-down foam camping mat to stand on. Into that I pack a rolled-up microfibre towel/poncho, a safety float, a thermos flask, a chocolatey protein bar, a beanie hat, and any other clothes I might need. There are companies such as [Swim Feral](https://swimferal.co.uk/) who have their custom change bags. They look amazing - I just haven't justified the price-tag yet!

Either way, you're going to be leaving some gear at the side of the river, or lake, or ocean, and you'll have to return to it. But, if you want to go from point A to point B, you'll need to float your gear along beside you.
